    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <p>Our company started as a small neighborhood store. We focused on serving our local customers and building
        strong
        relationships within our community. Over time, we grew. We started reaching out to nearby towns and then
        larger
        cities. Later we saw the need for our products and services in more places, so we decided to expand.</p>
    <p>Today we are proud to say that we have distribution centers all over the world. We have come a long way from
        our
        small store. You can find us in many different places. We are in A Coruña, Spain, and also in Barcelona. We
        have
        locations in Tokyo, Japan, and Brussels, Belgium. We also have distribution in Lima, Peru, and Sydney,
        Australia. We even have offices in Alaska (USA) and Toronto (Canada). We have worked hard to bring our
        products
        and services to people all over the world. We want to make sure that everyone has access to what we have to
        offer, wherever they live.</p>
